# Diabetes_Onward_Monitor
Using the scikit-learn diabetes dataset, which contains clinical examples of patients with diabetes, we will perform a regression task that gives us a prediction of diabetes progression in at-risk patients. The prediction is measured through a quantitative variable that turns out to be an index for the pathology in question.
